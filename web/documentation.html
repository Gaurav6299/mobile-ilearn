                        <h3>1.2&ndash;Development Process</h3>
                        <p>During development of MiLearn, we used a Scrum process of development. Our group would meet up at least once a week on Mondays for discussing our contributions towards the project, as well as planning on what part of the project to do next.</p>
                        
                        <p>What prevented our Scrum process from degenerating into the bug-fix model was rigor. Each week we would test reliability and correctness by creating various regression tests.</p>
                        
						<p>By using the Scrum method we had high visibility of our problems and goals each week. </p>
                        
                        <p>In addition, we took a modular approach towards development. Each group member focused on a different component of the app. This boosted overall group efficiency as we were able to concentrate on one item to do per week instead of several.</p>
                        
						<p>One problem was actually getting each component integrated properly each week. Some file writers and other libraries were not supported by Android and we had to find workarounds.</p>
                        
						<p>Previous Java classes we wrote had to be reimplemented in order to function properly with Tomcat.</p>
                        
						<p>Scalability of the system was tested after a small sample by increasing the database to 103 users, 20 lectures, 5 labs, 20 instructors, 5 lab instructors, and 50 assignments.</p>

                        <h3>3.1&ndash;Candice Bentejac</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Rationale</h4>
                        <p>Candice decided to work on the users, classes, login/logout module and the associated PostgreSQL database (hosted on the cloud using Amazon Web Services RDS). Later on during the project, the team had to handle data from several HTML forms to Java: Java Servlets have thus been used, as well as Amazon Web Services EC2, which allowed us to create a virtual machine on which we could install our server. Amazon Web Services S3 has also been used to store data that we could easily access from the cloud.</p>

                        <p>The goal of the project being to create an Android app, the backend of the application has been entirely coded using Java. We wanted MiLearn to be a complete and easy-to-use alternative to the BlackBoard iLearn mobile app. The users would thus have access to their Classes, Assignments, Grades and would be able to set up alerts with three different priority levels.</p>

                        <p>Since Rebecca used Javascript to develop the frontend, we needed a way to give her access to the data that we were parsing in Java. To do so, we decided to use JSON files that would be created with Java, sent to the cloud (more precisely, to an S3 bucket) and then parsed by Rebecca's JavaScript.</p>

                        <p>Candice's tasks consisted of creating Java objects that would represent the users and the classes. Users were divided into three categories: the Students, the Instructors, and the Teaching Assistants. Something similar was done with the Classes, which were divided into Lectures, Laboratories, and Discussions. Users can, depending on their status, be enrolled in a class or teach a class. The Teaching Assistant are both enrolled in and teaching a class.</p>

                        <p>Another of Candice's goals was to implement the login/logout module.The login module required a direct interaction between the user and the app. For this reason, it was developed in collaboration with Vincent, since he in charge of integrating the code in an Android environment. Vincent designed and implemented the login page, and Candice handled the login verification.</p>

                        <p>Candice also set up an Amazon Web Services RDS database that used PostgreSQL. She also collaborated with Krissi to maintain this database, and Krissi populated it with some user data.</p>

                        <p>Despite the resources already available, we very quickly needed to get data from the users to the backend, and decided to use HTML forms to do so. The users would only have to fill in those forms and submit them. Using Java Servlets, we can parse those HTML forms in Java and respond to the user's request - safely storing secure data while avoid corrupting the database. Candice consequently created an Amazon Web Services EC2 instance, setting up a virtual machine and installing Tomcat on it. Servlets were then implemented, stored, configured and mapped on this EC2 instance, on which Tomcat runs continuously.</p>

                        <h4>What Worked</h4>
                        <p>Candice implemented User and Classes classes, which were linked to the Login class, that Vincent integrated into the Android environment. Those Java classes allowed JSON files to be automatically generated and stored as soon as a user was logged in. Many libraries were integrated into the project to handle the database requests and to use Java Servlets. Java Servlets were used to treat data sent by users, and to regenerate certain JSON files when the context justified it. Amazon Web Services tools that were constantly used were also integrated to the code.</p>
                        
                        <p>Retrieving data from the database and generating the corresponding JSON files that could be read by Rebecca's code was the main challenge, since all the the user interface relied on the correctness of those JSON files.</p>

                        <h4>Rationale</h4>
                        <p>Vincent chose to work on the Android implementation due to prior experience working with Android development.</p>
                        
                        <p>He also split each page of the application into three separate activities. These consisted of the Login page, a Webview (the main MiLearn) page, and a page that went to the team's website.</p>
                        
                        <p>This relates to modularization as it minimized the amount of errors per activity. It also allowed for bugs to be more localized to a specific activity.</p>
                        
                        <h4>What Worked</h4>
                        <p>Vincent managed to incorporate Java calls to JavaScript methods within the Webview portion of the app. This allowed for the app to interact with AWS services. </p>

                        <h3>3.3&ndash;Rebecca Hom</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Rationale</h4>
                        <p>Rebecca decided to work on the user interface due to having previous experience working with implementing designs using JavaScript. Although it was possible to use Android development to create the user interface, using jQuery Mobile was allowed for a more efficient use of her skillset and it came with icons that could be used on the app.</p>
                        
                        <p>Since MiLearn is a simplified version of Blackboard iLearn, Rebecca arranged the essential functions into an intuitive design. This accomplished two things: retaining the simplicity of the app and splitting up each function into its own section. In turn, each of these sections could be styled and displayed as distinctly as possible. For the MiLearn app, the user would be able to access a Home screen, Classes, Assignments, Grades, and Settings. Each of those sections have JavaScript functions that generate the data to display from the database.</p>
                        
                        <p>It was also decided that the data displayed for a user would be taken from fixed JSON files. Each of these JSON files had fixed names and attributes for efficient parsing and displaying using JavaScript. These files would also be consistent for each user and user level which allowed for easily cached information and reduced the need to do new queries to the database.</p>
                        
                        <p>Also it was decided that a set of collapsibles would be used for Classes, Assignments, and Grades. This would hide information pertaining to a topic heading. In turn, this would be more efficient for the user as they would be able to scroll through headings to get what they needed instead of (potentially) large blocks of information.</p>
                        
                        <p>Alerts were added to the Home screen as a way to increase MiLearn's functionality as a mobile organizer. The user would be able to set three different alarm priority levels. These could be used as a buffer for the user to guage how much time they have left to do an assignment.  In addition, themes for the user interface were included. This would allow the user to somewhat customize MiLearn for their own use.</p>
                        
                        <p>Users were also split into two groups: students and instructors. The HTML page was then split into separate dividers to allow for either of those groups or a combination of them to use the app. HTML forms were used as a security feature for users modifying the database. This was to allow for input sanitation to prevent users from corrupting the database.</p>
                        
                        <h4>What Worked</h4>
                        <p>Rebecca implemented an HTML page that contained all of the screens for main MiLearn app that allowed for the screens to change using JavaScript.</p> 
                        
                        <p>In addition changing the screens, JavaScript was also used to parse the JSON files to display the data elements into their certain arrangements depending on what screen was used.</p>
                        
                        <p>JavaScript was also used to interact with Java to retrieve user information and move in and out from the Android app.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Features Designed and Implemented</h4>

                        <h4>Rationale</h4>
                        <p>Krissi decided to work on assigments, submissions, grades, Amazon S3 data management, and their associated databases. Seperation of concerns aided in modularization, but the difficulty in decoupling from one another ultimately resulted in the grouping of such tasks. By working on this set, important aspects shared among them permitted a level of abstraction for refined implementations and clearer dicussions with the team.</p>
                        
                        <h4>What Worked</h4>
                        <p>Java implementation of assignments, submissions, grades integrated with sql libraries and Amazon S3/database worked to sucessfully update the database and files simultaneously on s3, but it required more restriction than anticipated due to using Tomcat for processing forms.</p>
